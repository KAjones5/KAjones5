•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving?
The project is about a Corner Grocer Item Tracker program which was built using C++ programming language to track the frequency of items read from an input file. This item-tracking program also creates a backup file containing item frequencies. The program reads input files to develop a list of products bought along with the frequency the product has been bought per day. Finally, the program offers a menu-driven interface for users to perform actions like searching for item frequencies, printing item frequencies, and printing a histogram representation.
•	What did you do particularly well?
Generally, the program performed very well. I managed to insert color into the program template hence making it more eye-appealing to the users. The C++ code contained a single class named ItemTracker arranged into several functions. The user can only call a single function at a time hence making the program easy to comprehend.
•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
There are several things I wanted to add to enhance my code appearance and performance.  For example providing several inputs for option two for the users and emphasizing the first output letter to improve professional outlook of my program. 
•	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I had a tough time writing the switch case code. This coding section needed more attention and learning material than I had thought earlier. At first, I failed to get the right spacing for the menu. To solve this problem I changed one part of the code and ran it several times until it worked out perfectly. I relied on the SNHU library resources to assist me in correcting this problem.
•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Incorporating C++ with Python language will assist me a lot in my future programming projects in case I am required to combine various programming languages. Moreover, developing input text files will be valuable to these future projects. 
•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To make my program maintainable, readable, and adaptable to the users I will have to write all my codes inside functions. Also, this approach will make it less difficult if I need to make any changes to my codes.
